    "1. **What motivated you to develop FoodSave, and how does it address the issue of food wastage?**\n",
    "   - The motivation to develop FoodSave came from witnessing the widespread issue of food wastage while many people suffer from hunger. FoodSave aims to bridge this gap by creating an efficient system that connects surplus food from donors to those in need through a structured and user-friendly platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Can you explain the primary objectives of FoodSave and how it aims to achieve them?**\n",
    "   - The primary objectives of FoodSave are to reduce food wastage, ensure efficient food distribution to needy individuals, and create a transparent system for managing donations. It achieves these objectives by providing a platform where donors can easily create donation requests, admins can manage these requests, and agents can collect and distribute the food.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **What are the key features of FoodSave, and how do they contribute to the systemâ€™s overall goal?**\n",
    "   - Key features include user registration and authentication, donation request management, agent assignment, real-time notifications, and comprehensive dashboards for each user role. These features streamline the donation process, enhance coordination, and ensure transparency and accountability, thereby contributing to the overall goal of reducing food wastage and hunger.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **How did you choose the technology stack for FoodSave, and why did you select Node.js and MongoDB?**\n",

    "\n",
    "5. **Can you walk us through the architecture of FoodSave and explain how each layer interacts with the others?**\n",
    "   - FoodSave follows a layered architecture consisting of the presentation layer (UI), business logic layer (Express.js controllers), data access layer (Mongoose for MongoDB), and database layer (MongoDB). The presentation layer handles user interactions, the business logic layer processes requests, the data access layer interacts with the database, and the database layer stores the data. These layers interact through well-defined interfaces, ensuring modularity and scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **How do you handle user authentication and authorization in FoodSave?**\n",
    "   - User authentication and authorization are handled using Passport.js. During login, user credentials are validated, and a session is created. Authorization is managed through role-based access control, ensuring that users can only access resources appropriate to their roles (admin, donor, agent).\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **What are the roles of the different users (Admin, Donor, Agent) in the system, and how are these roles managed programmatically?**\n",
    "   - Admins manage donations and assign agents, donors create donation requests, and agents collect and distribute food. These roles are managed programmatically by assigning role attributes during user registration and implementing role-based access control in the application to restrict actions based on user roles.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Can you explain the structure of your MongoDB database and how you designed the schemas for donations and users?**\n",
    "   - The MongoDB database has collections for users and donations. The user schema includes fields for userID, firstName, lastName, email, password, role, and contactInfo. The donation schema includes fields for donationID, donorID, foodType, quantity, cookingTime, status, agentID, collectionTime, and address. These schemas are designed to ensure data integrity and support the application's functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **How do you ensure data consistency and integrity in your MongoDB collections?**\n",
    "   - Data consistency and integrity are ensured through schema validation using Mongoose. Required fields, data types, and constraints are defined in the schemas. Additionally, atomic operations and transactions are used to maintain consistency during complex operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Can you describe a complex query or aggregation you performed using Mongoose in your project?**\n",
    "    - A complex query involves aggregating donation data to generate reports for admins. For example, using the Mongoose aggregation framework, we can group donations by status and calculate the total number of donations for each status. This provides insights into donation trends and helps in resource planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **What design principles did you follow when creating the user interface for FoodSave?**\n",
    "    - The design principles include simplicity, consistency, responsiveness, and accessibility. The UI is designed to be intuitive, with a clean layout and easy navigation.

    "\n",
    "12. **How did you ensure that the UI is responsive and user-friendly across different devices?**\n",
    "    - Bootstrap was used to create a responsive layout that adjusts to different screen sizes. Media queries and flexible grid layouts ensure that the UI components adapt to various devices, providing a consistent and user-friendly experience on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. **Can you demonstrate how a user navigates through the FoodSave application, highlighting key functionalities?**\n",
    "    - A user logs in and is presented with a dashboard relevant to their role. Donors can create donation requests, view pending and previous donations. Admins can view and manage all donations, assign agents, and monitor the overall system. Agents can view their assigned collections, update their status, and mark donations as collected. Real-time notifications keep users informed of important actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. **What security measures have you implemented to protect user data in FoodSave?**\n",
    "    - Security measures include HTTPS for secure communication, bcrypt for hashing passwords, JWT tokens for session management, role-based access control, and regular security audits. These measures ensure that user data is protected from unauthorized access and potential threats.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. **How do you handle password storage and ensure that user passwords are secure?**\n",
    "    - Passwords are hashed using bcrypt before being stored in the database. Bcrypt is a secure hashing algorithm that adds a unique salt to each password, making it resistant to common attacks such as rainbow tables and brute force.\n",
    "\n",
    "16. **What steps have you taken to ensure the performance and scalability of FoodSave?**\n",
    "    - Steps include optimizing database queries, using indexing in MongoDB, implementing caching for frequently accessed data, using a load balancer for distributing traffic, and designing the system to be stateless and scalable horizontally.\n",
    "\n",
    "17. **How does FoodSave handle errors, and what mechanisms are in place to ensure graceful degradation?**\n",
    "    - Errors are handled using middleware in Express.js that catches exceptions and returns user-friendly error messages. Critical errors are logged for further investigation. Graceful degradation is ensured by providing fallback mechanisms, such as displaying cached data when the database is temporarily unavailable.\n",
    "\n",
    "18. **What future enhancements or features do you plan to add to FoodSave?**\n",
    "    - Future enhancements include developing a mobile application, integrating geolocation services for optimized collection routes, implementing gamification elements, and adding advanced analytics and reporting features to provide deeper insights into donation patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "19. **Can you explain a specific piece of complex logic in your code, such as the donation assignment algorithm?**\n",
    "    - The donation assignment algorithm involves selecting an available agent based on proximity to the donor and current workload. The algorithm queries the database to find agents within a certain radius, sorts them by availability, and assigns the nearest available agent to the donation request.\n",
    "\n",
    "20. **How do you handle state management in your application, especially for dynamic data like donation status?**\n",
    "   - State management is handled using a combination of server-side sessions and client-side JavaScript. Dynamic data like donation status is fetched from the server via AJAX calls and updated in real-time on the client side using frameworks like jQuery or plain JavaScript. WebSockets could also be used for real-time updates to enhance responsiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "21. **Can you discuss the process of implementing role-based access control in FoodSave?**\n",
    "   - Role-based access control (RBAC) is implemented using middleware in Express.js. When a user logs in, their role is retrieved and stored in the session. Middleware functions check the user's role before allowing access to certain routes or functionalities. For example, only users with the 'admin' role can access the admin dashboard and manage donations, while 'donor' and 'agent' roles have access to their specific functionalities.\n"
