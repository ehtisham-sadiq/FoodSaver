    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In today's world, food wastage is a significant issue, especially when juxtaposed against the persistent problem of hunger. Every day, tons of edible food are discarded, while millions of people go to bed hungry. Addressing this disparity requires innovative solutions that can efficiently connect surplus food with those in need. \"FoodSave\" is an initiative aimed at bridging this gap by creating a streamlined, user-friendly platform for managing food donations and collections. This project leverages modern web technologies to facilitate the donation process, ensuring that excess food reaches the underprivileged swiftly and safely.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "FoodSave is a web-based application designed to facilitate the donation of surplus food from donors to needy individuals via a structured network of agents and administrators. The platform supports three primary user roles:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Admins**: Oversee all activities, manage donations, and assign agents to collections.\n",
    "- **Donors**: Individuals or organizations willing to donate surplus food.\n",
    "- **Agents**: Responsible for collecting food donations from donors and distributing them to the designated recipients.\n",
    "\n",
    "The system offers functionalities such as donation requests, assignment of agents, tracking of donation statuses, and comprehensive dashboards for each user role. Additionally, the platform ensures secure user authentication and maintains a history of donations and collections, thus providing transparency and accountability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the significant amounts of surplus food produced daily, a substantial portion of it goes to waste rather than reaching those who need it. Existing food donation systems often lack efficiency and structure, resulting in logistical challenges, wasted resources, and missed opportunities to alleviate hunger. The primary challenges include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inefficient coordination between donors and collectors.\n",
    "- Lack of a centralized system to track and manage donations.\n",
    "- Inadequate mechanisms to ensure the safety and quality of donated food.\n",
    "- Difficulty in maintaining transparent records and accountability.\n",
    "\n",
    "FoodSave aims to address these issues by providing a cohesive, well-organized platform that simplifies the process of food donation, ensures efficient distribution, and maintains high standards of safety and accountability.\n",
